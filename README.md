# Text-Alignment Examples

A few quick examples of aligning text and formatting floating point numbers, including:

- examples using `String.format()` from the Java standard API
- examples using `StringUtils` from Apache's [Commons Lang](https://commons.apache.org/proper/commons-lang/) library, which attempts to make up for some of the standard Java API's many failings.

See the [App.java](./src/App.java) source code for details.

Note that the `.jar` file with the Commons Lang library has been downloaded and placed within the [lib](./lib/) directory.
